# Automatic Night Light Circuit

## Project Overview
This is a hands-on breadboard implementation of an automatic light sensor circuit that activates an LED when darkness is detected.

## Components Used
- **LDR** (Light Dependent Resistor) - Light sensor
- **NPN Transistor** (BC547/2N2222) - Electronic switch
- **Resistors** - 10kΩ (for LDR) & 330Ω (for LED)
- **LED** - Light output
- **9V Battery** - Power source
- **Breadboard** - Prototyping platform
- **Jumper Wires** - Connections

## 🔌 Breadboard Implementation
Since this is a practical breadboard project without a formal schematic, here's the connection guide:


## Applications
- Automatic street lights
- Night lamps
- Security systems
- Energy-saving systems
